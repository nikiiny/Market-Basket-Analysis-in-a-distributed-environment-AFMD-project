# Market-Basket-Analysis-in-a-distributed-environment-AFMD-project

The task is to implement a system finding frequent itemsets (aka market-basket analysis), analyzing the «IMDB» by using Apache Spark. The «IMDB» dataset is published on Kaggle, under IMDb non-commercial licensing. The analysis is done by considering movies as baskets and actors as items.

The analysis compares the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms performances.
